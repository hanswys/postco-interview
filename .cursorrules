YOU ARE AN EXPERT FULL STACK ENGINEER.

1. TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Axios.
- Backend: Python FastAPI.
- Database: SQLite (Raw SQL or SQLAlchemy is fine, prefer simple).

2. BEHAVIOR:
- ALWAYS check for existing files before creating new ones.
- When writing backend routes, ALWAYS include the Pydantic model.
- When writing frontend code, ALWAYS use Tailwind for styling (no CSS files).
- Keep code concise. Prefer speed and readability over over-engineering.

3. CONTEXT:
- The backend runs on port 8000.
- The frontend runs on port 5173.
- The database is at ../database/app.db relative to the backend.
